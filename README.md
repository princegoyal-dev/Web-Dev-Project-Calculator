<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


There are many great Calculator Projects available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a calculator so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others

Of course, no one calculator will serve all calculations since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this Project!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
